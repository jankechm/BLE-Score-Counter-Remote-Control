- Create Settings in top panel
	- Add option to specify if the app should automatically connect to lastly connected BT device on startup.

- When successfully connected to the Score Counter, display a message on it's display. Either do it
  just on it's display automatically, or send some command immediately. Also, indicate connection
  on the phone.

- Error status 133: when you see this status (or error 128), always try adding 60~100ms delay
  after the last successful operation.
- Remember device when connected. If out of range and in range again, reconnect automatically.
- Disconnect specific device instead of all.
    - Intermediary class between ConnectionManager and BluetoothFragment, that would know which
      device to disconnect from if needed?
- The OK/Send button could be visible all the time, to have the ability to update score second time,
  in case the CMD was not received by the BLE display on first time.
    - In that case, only one SET_SCORE command would be needed.
