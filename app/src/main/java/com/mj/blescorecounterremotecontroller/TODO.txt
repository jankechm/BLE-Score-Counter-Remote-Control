- When the watch loses connection and the phone changes the score and then the smartwatch changes
  the score while still offline, on next watch reconnect, the score from the watch should be applied
  to the BLE display, because it is the most recent change.

- When successfully connected to the Score Counter, display a message on it's display. Either do it
  just on it's display automatically, or send some command immediately.
- If there was no change in the score, but still SET_SCORE command was delivered, blink just with
  the colon.

- Disconnect specific device instead of all.
    - Intermediary class between ConnectionManager and BluetoothFragment, that would know which
      device to disconnect from if needed?
- Indicate changes in score: change = blue border; cancel = red border blink;
  confirmation = green border blink.

- Make "Auto-connect to last device" configurable.
- Make "Ask to bond" configurable.

- Define a coroutine in BleScoreCounterApp that will check each 3 seconds if BLE display is connected.
